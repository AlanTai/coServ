# coServ

coServ is a tidy web server implemented in Node.js. It is intended to be a server facade which could draw data or contents from multiple sources. Mesh up content from multiple sources can be done easily.

coServ can be used to build tiny websites with a few static pages or extremely complicated web applications. coServ help developers to decouple contents with presentations by a EJS-like template engine. HTML, Javascript and CSS files can all run through the template engine. Web front end designers can write much more flexible codes and easily reuse them repeatedly.

coServ is created in the view of the "internet of servers" paradigm. Servers crossing domains can interact with each other and co-produce contents that can best service their users. coServ is also created to help web site builders to leverage the COIMOTION API services.


##  Features
